# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a data analysis project focused on the "Wealth of Nations" dataset. The project demonstrates a range of data analyst skills, including data cleaning, data transformation, critical thinking, and data visualization. The primary tools used for this analysis are Microsoft Excel for data preparation and Tableau for creating interactive data dashboards.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** In this project, I meticulously cleaned the "Wealth of Nations" dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and dealing with outliers.

- **Data Transformation:** I performed various data transformations to make the dataset more suitable for analysis. This included aggregating and reshaping data to extract meaningful insights.

- **Critical Thinking:** The project demonstrates my ability to think critically and make informed decisions in the data analysis process. I carefully considered which variables were relevant and how they could be used to answer important questions.

- **Data Visualization:** Using Tableau, I created interactive and visually appealing data dashboards to present the insights derived from the dataset. These dashboards make it easy for stakeholders to understand and explore the data.
